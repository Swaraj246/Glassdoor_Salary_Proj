# Glassdoor Salary Prediction Project
## Project Overview
•	Created a tool that estimates data science salaries by scrapping over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor employing python and selenium and engineered features that can quantify values of data science skill.

•	Optimized 3 regression models by applying GridsearchCV to reach best model (Random Forest Regressor with an accuracy of 81%) and built a client-facing API through flask.
